# Link Preview App

The Link Preview App is a Flutter application that enables users to fetch metadata from a provided URL and display it as a preview. The app consists of two screens: the first screen prompts users to enter a title and a link, while the second screen shows the fetched metadata.

I made this app as a task assigned by Probtosoft Technologies.

# Features
Link Preview: Fetch metadata (title, description, image) from a URL and display it as a preview.
Two-Screen Interface: Navigate between a screen for inputting title and link and a screen for displaying the link preview.
